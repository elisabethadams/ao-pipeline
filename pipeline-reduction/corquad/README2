Crosstalk in PISCES has been corrected by combining 
a large stack of darks, selecting hot pixels from the combined 
image, identifying the comet-like ghosts of these hot pixels,
and fitting the shape of the ghosts along the rows
in which they occur.  The first crosstalk correction
script was written by Roelof de Jong in 1999.  The
correction was re-derived and updated by Jackie Monkiewicz
in 2004.  The readout has changed since then (what exactly
has changed?), so I have done a cursory re-check of the 
correction and have updated it again.

In "xtalk.1.ps" I first compare the de Jong and Monkiewicz
corrections.  The inset zooms in on the models of tail of the
comet-like shadow.  The de Jong correction (blue) spans 120 
pixels from the "pit" of the shadow, whereas the one by 
Monkiewicz spans 180 pixels (red).  The de Jong recipe  
will under-correct relative to the Monkiewicz recipe.  
However, as noted by Craig Kulesa, there are many more 
parameters in the Monkiewicz recipe, and there are 
discontinuities where different functions are joined (i.e.,
the kinks in red curve).  I have tried to fix these problems
in the new correction (green), which returns to the
original span of 120 pix.

I have chosen a set of 5 different shadows from an image
made from the combinations of ~40, 5 sec. darks, and
plotted them in "xtalk.2.ps" (yellow, blue, green, red
and black dotted profiles).  The average background
level, calculated from the 100 pixels to the right of
the shadow, has been subtracted from each shadow, and
they have all been scaled by the number of ADU in the
offending hottest pixel.  Note that all of the profiles
plotted are formed from the convolution of the shadows of
TWO adjacent hot pixels, with the left pixel being about
10 times as bright as its nieghbor on the right.  This
has been taken into account in the new correction (solid 
magenta line), which was based on the dotted blue curve.   
The Monkiewicz correction is also plotted
(solid black line), and does not fit the new crosstalk
pattern well in the pit; it leaves an obvious signature
residual in the corrected image.


The variation of the depth of the pit seems to vary with
the intensity of the offending pixel, and I have not yet
attempted to correct for this.  The depth of the pit increases
between 0.2% and 0.3% as the value of the hot pixel varies
between 6000 and 22000 ADU.  This needs to be addressed.
